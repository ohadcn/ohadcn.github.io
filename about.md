Ohad Cohen - Software Developer

Software developer, focused on security & accessibility.

Interested in Chatbots, Blockchain and Cyber.

### More Information

I'm a software developer with deep understanding of systems and processes (operating systems, network protocols, algorithms & information security).

I like to see, understand and improve the way system parts communicate and works, I do believe that a good project partitioning has a big impact on it’s ability to scale, to be integrated with another projects and reused.

Strong background in Bitcoin / blockchain systems, network security and Eye tracking technologies.
